# Algorithms-g

This course on Algorithms took place at Grammarly (Dec 2016). Organized by [Oleksii Sliusarenko](https://github.com/alyaxey)

All of the problems are publicly available on these two online resources:

1. [Timus Online Judge](http://acm.timus.ru/)
2. [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/problemset) (This website tends to be slow)

Each python module contains a link to the problem description in the module's docstring.
